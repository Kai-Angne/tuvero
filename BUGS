[REPORTED]
* Tab_History: Round 2 not started
* Toast: chunky positioning right before a toast disappears
  caused bye its <br> tag and possibly its padding/margin  
* Opera: tab_games: bye character doesn't display properly. Font problem?
* Safari for windows: no FileReader
* Safari for Windows: bye character looks strange (small and right-aligned)
  
[UNFIXABLE]
* Tab_Teams: overflow-x hidden, overflow-y visible
  cannot be fixed properly due to inconsistent default behavior:
  'visible' becomes 'auto' if used with 'hidden' as overflow-x
