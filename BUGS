[TODO]
* Tab_History: Round 2 not started
* Tab_Ranking: Name cut off
* CSV: escape header line ("Spieler 1")

[UNFIXABLE]
* Tab_Teams: overflow-x hidden, overflow-y visible
  cannot be fixed properly due to inconsistent default behavior:
  'visible' becomes 'auto' if used with 'hidden' as overflow-x
