[CONFIRMED]
* Toast: chunky positioning right before a toast disappears
  caused by its <br> tag and possibly its padding/margin  
* History cannot store more than two teams per game (Supermelee)

[IRREPRODUCIBLE]
* Android-Chrome: page reload on Debug->finishRound

[SHOULD BE FIXED now]
* github.io: autocomplete encoding is messed up

[UNFIXABLE]
* Tab_Teams: overflow-x hidden, overflow-y visible
  cannot be fixed properly due to inconsistent default behavior:
  'visible' becomes 'auto' if used with 'hidden' as overflow-x
* release version: must reload twice due to manifest update
  A note should now appear to notify the user
