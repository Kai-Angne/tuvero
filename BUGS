[REPORTED]
* Opera: tab_games: bye character doesn't display properly. Font problem?
* IE11: button.deletion: text aligned to top
* IE11: seams everywhere
* Firefox, Opera, Safari: Print Page doesn't show anything

[CONFIRMED]
* History is currently not able to store more than two teams per game (Supermelee)

[UNFIXABLE]
* Tab_Teams: overflow-x hidden, overflow-y visible
  cannot be fixed properly due to inconsistent default behavior:
  'visible' becomes 'auto' if used with 'hidden' as overflow-x
