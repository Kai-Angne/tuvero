[REPORTED]
* Tab_History: Round 2 not started
* Toast: chunky positioning right before a toast disappears
  caused bye its <br> tag and possibly its padding/margin  
* Opera: tab_games: bye character doesn't display properly. Font problem?
* Safari for windows: no FileReader
* Safari for Windows: bye character looks strange (small and right-aligned)
* IE11: button.deletion: text aligned to top
* IE11: seams everywhere
* IE11: Cannot download
* IE11: FileReader cannot readAsBinaryString
* github.io: autocomplete encoding is messed up
* release version: must reload twice due to manifest update
* Firefox, Opera, Safari: Print Page doesn't show anything (doesn't it print the subpages?)
  
[UNFIXABLE]
* Tab_Teams: overflow-x hidden, overflow-y visible
  cannot be fixed properly due to inconsistent default behavior:
  'visible' becomes 'auto' if used with 'hidden' as overflow-x
