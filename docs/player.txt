player.js

A Player instance holds general values of a player.
Those general values include properties that don't change that often, like
name, gender or location. They are used to identify a player in a list or using
a search method. A player can be serialized to and extracted from a single-line
string.

Properties:
Name (inline string)
Gender (m or f)
Year of Birth (integer)
Location (inline string, preferably without spaces)
Association (inline string, preferably an abbreviation)


Serialization format:
[Name]\[gender**][year]\[Location]\[Association]

  \ stands for an escaped backspace, thereby prohibiting the use of backspaces
  within strings

**  the gender is encoded in a single character (or '' if the developer wants)
