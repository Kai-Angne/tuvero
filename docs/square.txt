A Square is a representation of a (integer) square matrix with the main focus on typical
mat-mat and mat-vec functions as well as low-profile serialization.

The serialization format is as follows:

- every line in the string represents a line in the matrix
- in ever line, the integer values are separated by a space
- "0" is not printed. Thus, "  " equals " 0 "
- all spaces at the end of the line are omitted
- every line (including the last one) is finished by '\n',
  hence enabling 0x0 matrices (== empty string)
- the size of the matrix is  (number_of_lines - 1)
- entries outside the matrix are omitted from the string without error

Examples:

"" => []

"
" => [[0]]

"1
" => [[1]]

"1
 1
  1
" => [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]

"1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

" => [[1, 2, 3, 0], [4, 5, 6, 0], [7, 8, 9, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]

The Square class is designed to be elorpack-compressable
